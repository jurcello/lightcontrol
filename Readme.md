# About Lightcontrol

Lightcontrol is a program for controlling lights and more general DMX
controlled fixtures using osc and therefor is mainly a bridge between devices
that can send osc and DMX. Only one DMX universe is currently supported.
The only DMX device that is currently supported is the Enttec DMX Usb pro.
